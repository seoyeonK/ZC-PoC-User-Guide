# Source and Target VM installation
This section covers how you can install the Source and the Target VM. you should **ADD** VM information first, and then **GEN**ERATE VM.
## 1) ADD VM information
1. Choose Cloud platform where you will install the VM.

    <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/1.png' width='500'>

2. To register information of the VM, click `ADD`. 
    - **Text Field** : Enter the value in accordance with the constraints.

        <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/2.png' width='500'>

    - **Toggle List** : Select the region and the OS of the VM from each Toggle list.

        <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/3.png' width='550'>

    - **Hide and Extend** : To hide or extend fields, click `+`.

        <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/4.png' width='557'>

    - **Upload Files** 
        - Click `Choose` to select the file that you want to upload.

            <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/5.png' width='500'>

        - Click `Upload` to upload the file

            <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/6.png' width='557'>        

        - Click `Cancel` to unload the file that you have uploaded.

            <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/7.png' width='557'>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Notice / Precautions
A Target VM must contain **minimum 1 additional disk** and **each additional Disk's Size must field must be over 50(GB)**

&nbsp;
## VM information example
To see examples of recommended values of each VM information field, refer to [VM-info-example](./docs,files/VM-info-example.md)

&nbsp;
## Edit VM information
- By selecting each VM instance, you can check the details of each VM.

    <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/8.png' width='500'>

- To edit the values, click `Modify`. You can either click `Submit` to apply the changes, or click `cancel` to discard changes.
    ![](./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/10.png)
- By clicking `Copy`, you can duplicate the selected VM's information with "-1" added to the original name.

    <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/11Copy.png' width='557'>

- You can download the VM's information into files by clicking `Download`.

    <img src='./Image/2.Source_Target_Installation/9.png' width='300'>

## 2) Generate VM
After you add all of the VMs' information, you can generate the VM instances. It takes 10-20 minutes for ZCM agent to be installed after VM's installation.

1. Select the VM information to be installed and click `Gen` to create the instance

    <img src='./Image/3.generate_vm/1.png' width='400'>

2. You can check the status of the VM via `VM status`.

    <img src='./Image/3.generate_vm/2.png' width='400'>

    <img src='./Image/3.generate_vm/3.png' width='400'>

3. You can check the details of the VM installation via log file

    <img src='./Image/3.generate_vm/4.png' width='400'>


# ZConverter Migration demonstration
After installing Source and Target VM installation and agent installation, access the `ZConverter Migration management portal` to proceed with the migration. 

1. Access [https://www.z-cloud.net/](https://www.z-cloud.net/) with a web browser and log in with an administrator account.
    
    <img src='./Image/4.migration/1.png' width='300'>

2. Move to the platform tab you want to migrate among the "Cloud Migration" tabs. 
    (Ex: in case of AWS -> OCI migration, move to OCI tab)
